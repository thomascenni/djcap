Caprover is an open source tool which allows you to build your own PaaS server to host any type of applications and databases (NodeJS, Python, PHP, ASP.NET, Ruby, MySQL, MongoDB, Postgres, etc). Compared to commercial applications, like Heroku, it is a great and cheaper alternative.
Today I’ll show you how to create a Django application and deploy to Caprover step by step.
